### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]:Cupidn't is a playful, satirical web app where mischievous Cupid deliberately matches users with their most incompatible partners based on an entertaining personality quiz. The worse the compatibility, the closer they put you physically, with snarky commentary and humorous ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù roasts adding to the fun.
It‚Äôs a lighthearted parody of dating apps, designed purely for laughs and interactive amusement.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]: In a world saturated with dating apps promising perfect matches, the reality is often messy, unpredictable, and occasionally downright awkward. Traditional matchmaking algorithms strive to pair people based on compatibility, but what if, behind the scenes, Cupid actually thrives on chaos by matching the most incompatible pairs for his own amusement?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]: Cupidn't embraces this mischievous perspective by deliberately creating hilariously incompatible matches that highlight the fun and frustration of human relationships. Rather than solving the problem of finding ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù it satirizes it ‚Äî showing that sometimes, love (or the lack thereof) is a comedy of errors. This project playfully exposes the quirks of matchmaking and pokes fun at the idea that romance can be algorithmically perfected.
