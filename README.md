### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does] : Cupidn't is a playful, satirical web site where mischievous Cupid deliberately matches users with their most incompatible partners based on an entertaining personality quiz. The worse the compatibility, the closer they put you physically, with snarky commentary and humorous ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù roasts adding to the fun.
It‚Äôs a lighthearted parody of dating apps, designed purely for laughs and interactive amusement.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]: Cupidn't embraces this mischievous perspective by deliberately creating hilariously incompatible matches that highlight the fun and frustration of human relationships. Rather than solving the problem of finding ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù it satirizes it ‚Äî showing that sometimes, love (or the lack thereof) is a comedy of errors. This project playfully exposes the quirks of matchmaking and pokes fun at the idea that romance can be algorithmically perfected.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!] :  Cupidn't embraces this mischievous perspective by deliberately creating hilariously incompatible matches that highlight the fun and frustration of human relationships. Rather than solving the problem of finding ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù it satirizes it ‚Äî showing that sometimes, love (or the lack thereof) is a comedy of errors. This project playfully exposes the quirks of matchmaking and pokes fun at the idea that romance can be algorithmically perfected.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used] : HTML5: The structure and main markup of the app are written in standard HTML.

CSS3: All styling and visual themes are done in plain CSS, including custom fonts and responsive layouts.

JavaScript (Vanilla): All interactivity, quiz logic, data handling, profile generation, and page transitions are managed with plain (vanilla) JavaScript.



### Implementation
For Software: Architecture & Structure
Type: Single Page Application (SPA)

Languages: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

Design: 100% Frontend; all logic and state are handled in the browser (no backend/server)

User Flow
Welcome Page:

Asks for user‚Äôs name and gender with a playful prompt.

Validates inputs before letting the user proceed.

Compatibility Test:

Contains 9 multiple-choice questions (radio buttons).

Progress bar updates as each question is answered.

Each option represents a personality trait or lifestyle preference (e.g., introvert/extrovert, vegan/non-vegan).

Results Page (Cupidn‚Äôt‚Äôs Mismatches):

Shows a deliberately "bad" match: user is paired with a fake profile based on opposite answers.

Compatibility Score: Randomly generated, always low (e.g., 8‚Äì30%).

Distance Logic: Lower compatibility = closer distance ("next door neighbors"), better compatibility = far ("other side of the planet").

Profile Cards:

User and fake match profile cards, each with avatar, name, age, trait, and a commitment badge (üíç) if applicable.

Commentary & Roasts:

Commentary string is generated with satirical, context-aware text reflecting the incompatibility.

If the user is ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù and replays, displays a ‚ÄúCupid‚Äôs warning‚Äù roast.

Buttons:

"Match Them" (shows a snarky match confirmation)

"Beg Cupid to Undo" (shows random roast/rejection messages from Cupid)

"Cry Silently" (shows random self-pity popups)

All buttons are handled via JS popups/alerts for snarky responses.

Persistence (within session):

User state and match history are stored in in-memory JS objects.

Previous users/matches and repeated ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù attempts are recorded for heckling.

Data Generation
Fake Matches:

Profile data (name, avatar, age, trait, bio, commitment status) for matches is drawn from hardcoded arrays, chosen based on user‚Äôs gender (‚Äúopposite‚Äù or ‚Äúrandom‚Äù).

User ‚ÄúTraits‚Äù:

On quiz submission, a ‚Äúuser trait‚Äù string is generated from their answers for display.

Commentary:

Commentary bubbles are assembled from templates, sometimes referencing user answers or contrasting traits for comedic effect.

Visual/UI
Fonts:

Uses Comic Neue and Kalam (from Google Fonts) for a playful, hand-drawn vibe.

Color/Theme:

Bright, valentine-gone-wrong palette (pinks, oranges, yellows).

Profile Cards & Modals:

Results display in side-by-side cards, with hover and highlight effects.

Clickable profile modals (for details) use the same theme and show big avatars and bios.

Responsive Layout:

Flexbox used for layout; media queries ensure usability on mobile devices.

No Third-Party Dependencies
No React/Vue/Angular, no build tooling, no package managers.

Uses only ES6 vanilla JS; modularized via local functions.

Running
How to run: Just open the .html file in any modern browser. No server required.

In summary:
Cupidn't is a satirical, SPA-style website built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring custom UI, comical matching, and mischievous Cupid commentary‚Äîall in a single self-contained frontend file.


User Data Handling
No Accounts or Logins:
Users never create accounts, log in, or provide passwords. Only a first name and selected gender are collected at the start, purely for in-page personalization and satire.

All Data Stays Local:
All user data and quiz answers are stored entirely in-browser, in JavaScript memory (variables/objects). Nothing is transmitted to a server, database, or any external location.

Session-Only Memory:
User information (name, gender, quiz answers, previous ‚Äúmatches,‚Äù if they‚Äôre a repeat user, etc.) exists only for as long as the page is open.

If the user closes or reloads the page, their data is lost‚Äîthere‚Äôs no persistent storage.

Optional: You can extend the app to use localStorage for persistence, but by default, it doesn‚Äôt.
